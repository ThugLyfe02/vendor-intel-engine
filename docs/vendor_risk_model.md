# Vendor Risk Model

The Vendor Risk Model transforms individual detection results into vendor-level intelligence.

## Objective

Move from:
- Isolated anomaly flags

To:
- Structured vendor risk profiling

---

## Vendor Risk Profile Components

For each vendor:

- Total Vendor Spend
- Total Flagged Spend
- Flagged Spend Percentage
- Detection Count
- Recurring Exposure (Annualized)
- Duplicate Frequency
- Risk Concentration Score

---

## Proposed Vendor Risk Score (Conceptual)

Vendor Risk Score =
    (Flagged Vendor Spend / Total Vendor Spend)
    × Confidence Weight
    × Detection Density

Where:

Detection Density =
    Number of Detections / Total Vendor Transactions

---

## Why This Matters

Most accounting systems show transaction-level issues.

This engine elevates detection into:

Vendor-level structural risk intelligence.

This allows:

- Vendor prioritization
- Exposure ranking
- Risk concentration monitoring
- Executive-level reporting
