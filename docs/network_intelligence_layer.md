# Network Intelligence Layer

The Network Intelligence Layer introduces anonymized, cross-company vendor behavior modeling.

This layer transforms the engine from a single-company anomaly detector into a financial intelligence network primitive.

---

## Core Principle

No raw financial data is shared.

Only abstracted vendor behavior metrics are aggregated.

The system collects anonymized structural signals such as:

- Vendor Billing Volatility Index
- Recurring Consistency Score
- Duplicate Density Rate
- Price Drift Variance
- Vendor Risk Percentile Ranking
- Materiality Exposure Percentile

---

## Privacy Model

The network layer operates under strict constraints:

- No transaction-level sharing.
- No company-identifiable data.
- No absolute revenue disclosure.
- Aggregation occurs on anonymized vendor behavior signals only.

---

## Vendor Behavioral Fingerprint

Each vendor can be represented by a behavioral profile:

- Average billing interval stability
- Amount volatility standard deviation
- Recurring inflation rate
- Duplicate anomaly frequency
- Cross-client recurrence density

This creates a vendor-level structural intelligence layer.

---

## Competitive Advantage

Traditional accounting tools analyze internal data only.

This system can evolve into:

- Cross-industry vendor benchmarking
- Vendor risk percentile modeling
- Ecosystem-level anomaly detection
- Financial fragility scoring

This establishes defensible network effects.
