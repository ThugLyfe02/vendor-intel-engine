# Network Intelligence Layer

The Network Intelligence Layer transforms the Vendor Intelligence Engine from a single-company analyzer into a future financial intelligence network primitive.

This layer enables cross-company vendor behavior modeling without exposing raw financial data.

---

## 1. Architectural Philosophy

Traditional accounting systems operate within a single company's dataset.

This engine is designed to eventually operate across anonymized behavioral abstractions, enabling structural vendor intelligence at the ecosystem level.

It does NOT aggregate raw financial data.
It aggregates behavioral signals.

---

## 2. Anonymized Vendor Behavioral Metrics

Each participating company contributes derived vendor metrics such as:

- Billing Interval Stability Index
- Amount Volatility Score
- Duplicate Density Rate
- Recurring Dependency Ratio
- Price Drift Coefficient
- Structural Risk Score
- Vendor Materiality Percentile

No transaction-level records are shared.

Only statistical abstractions.

---

## 3. Cross-Client Risk Scoring Framework

The system can compute:

- Vendor Risk Percentile Ranking
- Vendor Volatility Percentile
- Recurrence Density Percentile
- Cross-Industry Structural Drift Patterns

Example:

Vendor X may be:
- 92nd percentile in billing volatility
- 85th percentile in recurring obligation growth
- 78th percentile in duplicate density

This enables benchmarking.

---

## 4. Vendor Volatility Percentile Modeling

Volatility metrics may include:

- Standard deviation of billing amount over time
- Billing interval variance
- Drift acceleration
- Recurring inflation rate
- Outlier frequency

These are computed locally, shared as anonymized signals, and aggregated into percentiles.

---

## 5. Aggregated Signal Architecture

Future architecture may include:

1. Local Engine
   - Computes vendor behavioral fingerprints

2. Signal Abstraction Layer
   - Removes identifiable fields
   - Hashes vendor identifiers
   - Aggregates metrics only

3. Network Aggregation Layer
   - Builds percentile benchmarks
   - Computes cross-client vendor distributions
   - Publishes anonymized risk bands

No raw revenue.
No transaction data.
No company identifiers.

---

## 6. Privacy-Preserving Design

Privacy guarantees:

- No raw transaction sharing
- No absolute spend disclosure
- No identifiable vendor-client linkage
- Hash-based vendor mapping
- Metric-level aggregation only

The network layer is privacy-first and signal-only.

---

## 7. Strategic Implication

This elevates the system from:

"Vendor leak detection tool"

to:

"Financial Intelligence Network Infrastructure"

It creates defensibility via:

- Behavioral vendor fingerprinting
- Ecosystem-level benchmarking
- Cross-company percentile intelligence
- Structural risk modeling at scale
