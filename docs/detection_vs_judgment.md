# Detection vs Judgment

The Vendor Intelligence Engine intentionally separates:

Detection:
- Identifies structural financial patterns.
- Flags anomalies based on deterministic rules.
- Produces explainable and traceable outputs.

Judgment:
- Determines business action.
- Evaluates vendor relationships.
- Decides remediation steps.
- Applies organizational policy.

---

## Why This Separation Matters

Financial systems must avoid overstepping into automatic decision-making.

By separating detection from judgment, the engine:

- Reduces liability risk.
- Prevents overconfidence bias.
- Maintains governance neutrality.
- Supports audit environments.

The engine surfaces structured intelligence.

It does not autonomously execute financial decisions.

## Architectural Implication

Detection modules:
- Must remain deterministic.
- Must not embed business policy.
- Must not modify financial records.

Future governance layers may:
- Apply configurable policy rules.
- Escalate vendor risk.
- Trigger human review workflows.

---

## Strategic Philosophy

Anomaly detection is infrastructure.

Business judgment is governance.

This engine is designed as infrastructure first.
