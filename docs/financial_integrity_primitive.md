# Financial Integrity Primitive

This engine is designed as a financial integrity primitive.

A primitive is a foundational system component upon which higher-level systems are built.

---

## What This Means

The engine does not aim to:

- Replace accounting systems.
- Replace ERP platforms.
- Replace governance frameworks.

Instead, it provides:

- Deterministic structural analysis
- Vendor-level risk modeling
- Materiality-aware exposure insights
- Audit-traceable anomaly detection

It is infrastructure, not interface.

## Why Primitive Thinking Matters

Most financial tools are built as:

- Dashboards
- Plugins
- Reporting layers

This engine is built as:

- A composable analytical core
- An infrastructure layer
- A governance-ready detection engine

This allows it to:

- Integrate across accounting platforms
- Power API-based SaaS layers
- Support compliance-heavy environments
- Evolve without UI coupling
