# Trust Model

The Vendor Intelligence Engine operates under a structured trust model.

---

## Trust Assumptions

1. Input data is untrusted until validated.
2. Financial arithmetic must avoid floating point operations.
3. All detection logic must be reproducible.
4. Severity classification must be centralized.
5. No mutation of source transaction data.

---

## Trust Guarantees

The engine guarantees:

- Deterministic outputs.
- Explicit rule traceability.
- Currency-scoped aggregation.
- Transparent impact estimation.

## Why Trust Modeling Matters

Financial systems fail not from lack of detection, but from erosion of trust.

Trust is maintained through:

- Determinism
- Explainability
- Boundary clarity
- Audit traceability
