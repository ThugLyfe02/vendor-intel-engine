# Risk Concentration Index (RCI)

The Risk Concentration Index measures how financially exposed a business is to vendor-level anomalies.

---

## Objective

Move from:
- Isolated anomaly detection

To:
- Structural exposure modeling

---

## Conceptual Formula

RCI =
    (Total Flagged Spend / Total Company Spend)
    × Vendor Risk Dispersion Factor

---

## Vendor Risk Dispersion Factor

The dispersion factor increases when:

- A small number of vendors account for most flagged spend.
- Multiple anomalies cluster within a single vendor.
- Recurring exposure compounds over time.

This helps identify concentrated financial fragility.

---

## Why This Is Different

Most accounting tools report individual anomalies.

This system models structural risk concentration.

This enables:

- Executive-level risk assessment
- Vendor prioritization
- Exposure heat mapping
- Longitudinal financial risk tracking

---

## Future Evolution

- Rolling-period RCI tracking
- Vendor risk heat maps
- Policy-driven concentration alerts
- Cross-period structural drift analysis
