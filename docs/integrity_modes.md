# Integrity Modes

The Vendor Intelligence Engine can operate under different integrity enforcement modes.

---

## 1. Monitoring Mode

- Detects anomalies.
- Produces structured output.
- No enforcement logic.

Use Case:
Passive financial oversight.

---

## 2. Audit Mode

- Strict thresholds.
- Elevated materiality sensitivity.
- Full audit trace metadata.
- Dataset fingerprinting required.

Use Case:
Pre-audit preparation or compliance validation.

---

## 3. Governance Mode (Future)

- Policy-driven enforcement.
- Escalation thresholds.
- Vendor risk concentration alerts.
- Multi-period drift detection.

Use Case:
Ongoing financial governance.

## Why This Matters

Most accounting tools are static.

This engine is designed to evolve into a governance-aware financial integrity system.
