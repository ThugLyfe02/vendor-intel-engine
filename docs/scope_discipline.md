# Scope Discipline Doctrine

The Vendor Intelligence Engine intentionally avoids:

- Automated vendor action recommendations
- Implicit cross-currency conversions
- Black-box machine learning scoring
- Financial record mutation
- Silent threshold escalation
- Hidden heuristic adjustments

---

## Philosophy

Systems handling money must optimize for:

- Precision over speed
- Clarity over novelty
- Determinism over hype
- Governance compatibility over automation spectacle
- Reproducibility over probabilistic opacity

This engine is designed to remain structurally disciplined.

---

## Design Constraints

The engine enforces:

- Deterministic detection modules
- Centralized risk scoring logic
- Currency-scoped aggregation
- Explicit policy modeling
- Structured explainability contracts

Scope is constrained intentionally to prevent architectural drift.

---

## Why Scope Discipline Matters

Financial systems often degrade when:

- Features expand faster than risk modeling
- ML replaces explainability
- Policy becomes implicit
- Detection logic becomes entangled with business judgment

This doctrine preserves:

- Audit integrity
- Predictability
- Governance compatibility
- Infrastructure composability

---

## Future Expansion Philosophy

Future ML layers (if introduced) must:

- Be optional
- Sit above deterministic detection
- Preserve explainability
- Never replace the core deterministic engine

The deterministic core remains the foundation.
