# Vendor Intelligence Engine

Deterministic financial anomaly detection engine for identifying vendor payment leakage with explainable risk scoring.

## Purpose

This project is designed to detect:
- Duplicate payments
- Recurring vendor subscriptions
- Financial anomalies
- Vendor-level risk concentration

The system prioritizes:
- Deterministic logic
- Financial precision (Decimal-safe)
- Explainability
- Enterprise-compatible architecture
- Test-driven reliability

## Architecture Principles

- Strict domain modeling
- Separation of concerns
- Centralized risk scoring
- Currency-aware aggregation
- No silent failures
- Configurable thresholds

## Status

Early-stage core engine development.
